# mrpSolver

Use this script to calculate a material resource planning (MRP) order-release schedule. When run, the mrpSolver will ask the user to input an item master file (IMF), master production schedule (MPS), and bill of materials (BOM) in CSV file format. Please check the example files provided for correct formatting. To test the sample files, simply type "demo" for each of the input questions while running the script. For testing your own files, place the files in the same folder as the "main.py" script and include the ".csv" extension when inputting the file names.

Generally, a master production schedule should be planned based on available resources and each product's production requirements. This program will not fill past-due orders with presently available resources. Instead, it returns an order-release schedule representing past-due orders in exact quantities (rather than lot size quanities) in the time periods they should have been ordered/produced. This is done in order to allow users the greatest flexibility (e.g. expediting production, etc.).
